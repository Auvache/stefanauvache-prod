Scott Adams changed mine.</p>\n        <p>Adams is the mastermind behind\n          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dilbert.com/\">\n            <span style=\"color:rgb(17, 85, 204);\">the Dilbert comic strip</span>\n          </a>. He also has a blog.\n          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html\">\n            <span style=\"color:rgb(17, 85, 204);\">One of the articles on that blog</span>\n          </a>\n          is about becoming a better writer.</p>\n        <p>Adam’s says, in a nutshell:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Keep it simple</li>\n          <li>Get rid of extra words</li>\n          <li>The first sentence should grab the reader</li>\n          <li>Avoid multiple thoughts in a single sentence</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Basically, writing should be as easy to understand as possible. Make your work entertaining, but not at the expense of simplicity. Scott Adams’ 263-word post gave me the confidence to start writing daily (you’re the man Scott).</p>\n        <p>The last line of the article says:</p>\n        <p>\n          <em>“That’s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good writing. You’re welcome.</em>”</p>\n        <p>I first assumed that the remaining 20% would include granular, complex stuff like, “know your target audience” or “have an editor run through your work.”</p>\n        <p>Then I read\n          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.W_0pCVG1Cxh31wjGmGLw54QT5U3VPM1qIdukXPZUN_IZgXW5oXjOJ84l23Wxft6abqQT15l7f-TkP_m1dS9x7PN1sBgkVtsnHLrmkHya7qgCGrMrc3KAsVAHBl8d043r5XGsUESwNDJUCXwLMnm8yO-BIHgCcGbav2nSaxUkP4Tm-dey10Ynf-BLwDwHbiX41dCfXuj-nkEvppBl8R8c4okf39hVN2kRVaM6kNdEKDc.6iaTszJwXLg-DTXNQp9emZB8BQUbnH83EZB4sYK1EMg&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;hvadid=616931716525&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9033614&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=7221299162307047327&amp;hvtargid=kwd-342894155&amp;hydadcr=24661_13611822&amp;keywords=the+war+of+art&amp;qid=1708530935&amp;sr=8-1\">\n    <span style=\"color:rgb(17, 85, 204);\">\n      <em>The War of Art</em>\n    </span>\n          </a>\n          by Steven Pressfield.</p>\n        <p>Pressfield’s writing embodies many of the principles from Adams’ post. His sentences are concise. His “chapters” are often a single paragraph.\n          <em>The War of Art</em>\n          itself barely breaks 150 pages. Anyone would be hard pressed to cut a phrase from that book without making it worse. If books were people,\n          <em>The War of Art\n          </em>would have 3% body fat.</p>\n        <p>But the thing that makes Steven Pressfield a great writer isn’t the leanness of his writing. Every portion of\n          <em>The War of Art</em>\n          is meaningful. His singular focus on what he calls\n          <em>Resistance\n          </em>captivates and inspires the reader.</p>\n        <p>The main characteristic of great writing is something great to write about.</p>\n        <p>If I could append a sentence to Scott Adams’ nigh perfect blog post, it would be this:</p>\n        <p>“<em>That’s it. You just learned 80% or the rules of good writing. Now find something worth writing about.”</em>\n        </p>\n        <p>Write simply. Keep it lean. Convey ideas to your audience as clearly as possible. And, for the love of Scott and Steven, write about something meaningful.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n</template>\n\n<script setup>\nimport getArticleData from \"@/functions/getArticleData\";\nlet article = getArticleData()\n</script>","import script from \"./BetterBusinessWriting.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./BetterBusinessWriting.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\n\nconst __exports__ = script;\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["getArticleData","route","useRoute","pageName","path","replace","article","Articles","filter","item","slug","__exports__"],"sourceRoot":""}
