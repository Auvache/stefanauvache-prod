Scott Adams changed mine.</p><p>Adams is the mastermind behind <a target="_blank" href="https://dilbert.com/"> the Dilbert comic strip </a>. He also has a blog. <a target="_blank" href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html"> One of the articles on that blog </a> is about becoming a better writer.</p><p>Adam&#39;s says, in a nutshell:</p><ul><li>Keep it simple</li><li>Get rid of extra words</li><li>The first sentence should grab the reader</li><li>Avoid multiple thoughts in a single sentence</li></ul><p>Basically, writing should be as easy to understand as possible. Make your work entertaining, but not at the expense of simplicity. Scott Adams&#39; 263-word post gave me the confidence to start writing daily (you&#39;re the man Scott).</p><p>The last line of the article says:</p><p><em>&quot;That&#39;s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good writing. You&#39;re welcome.</em>&quot;</p><p>I first assumed that the remaining 20% would include granular, complex stuff like, &quot;know your target audience&quot; or &quot;have an editor run through your work.&quot;</p>',10),l=["href"],p=(0,a.Lk)("em",null,"The War of Art",-1),m=[p],u=(0,a.Fv)("<p>Pressfield&#39;s writing embodies many of the principles from Adams&#39; post. His sentences are concise. His &quot;chapters&quot; are often a single paragraph. <em>The War of Art</em> itself barely breaks 150 pages. Anyone would be hard pressed to cut a phrase from that book without making it worse. If books were people, <em>The War of Art </em>would have 3% body fat.</p><p>But the thing that makes Steven Pressfield a great writer isn&#39;t the leanness of his writing. Every portion of <em>The War of Art</em> is meaningful. His singular focus on what he calls <em>Resistance </em>captivates and inspires the reader.</p><p>The main characteristic of great writing is something great to write about.</p><p>If I could append a sentence to Scott Adams&#39; nigh perfect blog post, it would be this:</p><p>&quot;<em>That&#39;s it. You just learned 80% or the rules of good writing. Now find something worth writing about.&quot;</em></p><p>Write simply. Keep it lean. Convey ideas to your audience as clearly as possible. And, for the love of Scott and Steven, write about something meaningful.</p>",6),c={class:"resources"},d=(0,a.Lk)("p",null,"Resources",-1),f=(0,a.Lk)("li",null,[(0,a.Lk)("a",{target:"_blank",href:"https://dilbert.com/"},"Dilbert.com")],-1),g=(0,a.Lk)("li",null,[(0,a.Lk)("a",{target:"_blank",href:"https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html"},"The Day You Become A Better Writer by Scott Adams")],-1),b=["href"];var k={__name:"BetterBusinessWriting",setup(t){return(t,e)=>((0,a.uX)(),(0,a.CE)("section",i,[(0,a.Lk)("div",r,[(0,a.Lk)("div",null,[h,(0,a.Lk)("p",null,[(0,a.eW)("Then I read "),(0,a.Lk)("a",{target:"_blank",href:(0,n.R1)(s).books.theWarOfArt},m,8,l),(0,a.eW)(" by Steven Pressfield.")]),u,(0,a.Lk)("div",c,[d,(0,a.Lk)("ul",null,[f,g,(0,a.Lk)("li",null,[(0,a.Lk)("a",{href:(0,n.R1)(s).books.theWarOfArt,target:"_blank"},"The War of Art by Steven Pressfield",8,b)])])])])])]))}};const w=k;var y=w},485:function(t){t.exports=JSON.parse('{"books":{"theAlchemist":"https://amzn.to/4deeuFz","deepWork":"https://amzn.to/4fdbN8V","mansSearchForMeaning":"https://amzn.to/3LAFvXM","theWarOfArt":"https://amzn.to/3ymtMcp","littlePrinces":"https://amzn.to/3zSEfwJ","freakonomics":"https://amzn.to/4fvlAHR","mastery":"https://amzn.to/3Sn2E3Y","the48LawsOfPower":"https://amzn.to/3XjL8QN","chronicles":"https://amzn.to/4dDJbVj","meditations":"https://amzn.to/3WAGPQP","onWriting":"https://amzn.to/3SN0JWL","howToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeople":"https://amzn.to/4fpBh32","influence":"https://amzn.to/3A5eLfE","focalPoint":"https://amzn.to/3StJ46c","theRichestManInBabylon":"https://amzn.to/3Yl6Gh5","the4HourWorkWeek":"https://amzn.to/3LIYway","toolsOfTitans":"https://amzn.to/3Abupq4","officerClemmons":"https://amzn.to/3WGNwQ4","theArtofLearning":"https://amzn.to/3ySmmhy","thinkLikeAFreak":"https://amzn.to/4fV2wCS","gordonRamsay":"https://amzn.to/4dSLtPT","taoTeChing":"https://amzn.to/3ACnOVK","philosophyOfSoftwareDesign":"https://amzn.to/4dxYa2R","leonardoDaVinci":"https://amzn.to/3ACswmu","theCodeBreaker":"https://amzn.to/477BSTs","thePhoenixProject":"https://amzn.to/3Zo9BWL","theDevOpsHandbook":"https://amzn.to/3XneA7w","theBoysInTheBoat":"https://amzn.to/4eP1Ayx","excellentAdviceForLiving":"https://amzn.to/3Nppi8M","perennialSeller":"https://amzn.to/3AA9qgW"}}')}}]);
