To my knowledge, there weren&#39;t any mental health awareness social media accounts. To be frank, I personally thought conditions like depression didn&#39;t exist. I thought saying “I have depression” was an excuse to be sad and stay sad. I also thought that one could simply take a “happy pill” and it would be fine. Yeah, if I could give my younger self a facepalm and a light slap upside the head, I would.</p><p>When I look back on my life, there was a major personality shift as I went from childhood into puberty. I don&#39;t think there is anything typically uncommon about that as hormones start raging and the body starts changing. But still, it makes me wonder how long something like sleep apnea wreaked havoc in my life.</p><p>I can&#39;t remember a time where I didn&#39;t enjoy a good nap or sleep in general. I loved my naps all throughout childhood and was generally a very happy and smiley kid. I was always playing games and was full of imagination with whatever story I was inventing. But sleep hit differently as I left my happy days of childhood and started my teen era and I slipped into the “tired and busy teen” category.</p><p>I remember specifically as a teenager going through all the motions of the busy student life using naps as a form of reward. I remember hyping myself up all day just to make it to that sweet bell sound at 3:01 pm that would signify I could go home and take a nap.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t involved in a ton of extra activities as I needed more time than the average student for my homework due to my dyslexia, but I always had time for a nap before I&#39;d crack the books open and get started. I didn&#39;t spend too much time with friends after school either as I didn&#39;t feel up to it most days. I hung out with them at school and that was enough for me most of the time.</p><p>I had a schedule that allowed me to rest and cope with high school life, so the idea that there might be anything wrong like a sleep disorder or mental illness didn&#39;t exist in my mind. It was just a matter of getting through this part in my life.</p><p>As I transitioned from a high schooler to a college student, I quickly found the times I could nap or get extra rest or time to “decompress” away from other people. My first semester as a Freshman, I had class at 7:45 in the morning. I remember cheering myself forward with the thought that I had time for an hour nap after class before my next class started.</p><p>One morning, I remember looking at my eyes getting ready for class, and they were bloodshot. “Typical,” I thought for someone who has left home for the first time and was starting to build a life. What breaks my heart when I think back to my little freshman self was how feeling numb and tired were so commonplace to me that I didn&#39;t know life to be any different. I still didn&#39;t believe in conditions such as mental illness.</p><p>After graduating with my associates degree, I decided to serve as a volunteer for my church and went to Europe for 18 months. It was while I was living in the Netherlands that everything finally came crashing down.</p><p>All of a sudden, I had a schedule that was given to me that I was expected to follow to the letter. I had people to see and responsibilities to fulfill. I was going all day long and all minutes of my day were planned from 6:00 in the morning till 9:00 at night. This wasn&#39;t a bad thing; I have volunteered to do it. However, to meet the demands of the schedule, I remember taking 10 minutes at lunch to eat so I could spend the remaining 50 minutes napping. It worked most days, but sometimes I wasn&#39;t able to get that nap in.</p><p>Then I experienced the worst mental breakdown of my life. I felt my soul shatter, and I became an empty husk of the person I once was. The next thing I knew, I was sitting in a therapist&#39;s office in Southern Belgium being diagnosed with depression and prescribed medication to help me get back on my feet.</p><p>That is one of the biggest pieces of humble pie I&#39;ve ever eaten. I knew next to nothing about depression, and from talking with the therapist about my teenage years, it might have been lurking in my mind for a long time. The final trigger was living and working at such a high level of demand.</p><p>Being diagnosed with depression sparked a want in me to know everything about it and the power it held in my life. I was determined that I wasn&#39;t going to take this lying down. I was going to figure out how to live with it to the best of my abilities. So, I started learning and asking questions. I started writing in journals I called “My Brains” to better understand this mental illness I had once thought was an excuse to be sad and despondent.</p><p>From real, first-hand experience, I learned quickly that depression is way more than sadness.</p><p>Despite my diagnosis, I wanted to complete my service. I knew that it would be hard emotionally, but that it would be worth it to me in the end.</p><p>Just before finishing my service and returning to the States, I ended up in the hospital. My body locked up, and I succumbed to tremors and muscle spasms. I recall waking up in the hospital, disoriented and confused, being told that they had given me muscle relaxants and that I was clear to leave as there wasn&#39;t anything else physically wrong with me.</p><p>I arrived home in the United States in time for Thanksgiving in 2015. The medication I was put on in the Netherlands was all but a band aid and not an actual solution. It helped me survive, not thrive.</p><p>Memories from this time in my life are spotty at best as the depression grew stronger in my mind. Being safe at home meant that it was time to figure out a more permanent treatment plan as well as find a better mix of medications. I found myself in the office of a Nurse Practitioner of Mental Health and began intense therapy two to three times a week.</p><p>To add to the depression diagnosis, he added anxiety, body dysmorphia, and ADHD. I remember leaving that appointment feeling like I had a grocery list of all the things wrong with me.</p><p>I spent over half of 2016 feeling sick, trying to find the right combination of medications. I tried many antidepressants, anxiety medications, ADHD helpers, as well as sleep aids to help me sleep with all the medications in my system. Some medications were harder to try out than others. I would spend a month feeling super sick from a medication only for it to not get better and switch to another. With each medication switch, I felt my hopes sink lower.</p><p>I was determined to have therapy and medication work so I could be well enough to start school again in fall of 2016. I had been accepted to my dream college with the help of my associates and my volunteer service. The thought of going to college kept me motivated to keep trying medications. Then with some luck, my Nurse Practitioner found a workable mixture of medications where the physical side effects were minimal. Still wasn&#39;t great, but good enough. With new found confidence, I charged ahead. I moved out of state to attend school.</p><p>The first few months of school were alright. I remember feeling like I made it. I made it through all the mental illness I had the medication I needed. Surely, I could now just live a “normal” life. I fell into my old patterns. Finding times to nap and times where I could decompress. I set my class schedule so I didn&#39;t have to get up super early. However, the medications I was on started to not feel like enough to deal with the emotional ups and downs of college. Perhaps they had been enough when I was safely tucked away at home, but they started being less and less effective.</p><p>When I came home at the end of the semester for the holidays, my mental health practitioner made some adjustments to my medication. Increasing here and decreasing here. I had hope for the next semester, but was still a bit nervous as I was taking on heavier subjects.</p><p>Only a few weeks into the semester, I found myself staring at yet another failed math test. It didn&#39;t seem to matter how hard I studied or tried to do what the tutor said – I was failing math right, left, and center. I had been a valedictorian in high school and graduated with honors with my associates. I knew how to stick it out and learn. However, I had started to become more tired than I ever remember being. I often crashed in the afternoons, needing a nap. The headaches started to become more noticeable. When I tried to do my homework, it was like hitting a brick wall.</p><p>Never before had I felt more dispirited in my performance as a student. I realized I couldn&#39;t keep up like I used to and realized that if I didn&#39;t do something, it would only get worse. I remember calling my mom on the way to chemistry. I told her everything that was happening. I remember her saying:</p><blockquote><p class="fw-bold">“Kajsa, you can come home. It&#39;s okay.”</p></blockquote><p>I think I cried right there in the hallway outside of the lecture hall where my chemistry class was taking place, knowing what I had to do for the sake of my physical and mental health.</p><p>It took only a day before I was provided with a medical withdrawal from school and had all my things loaded up in the back of my parent&#39;s car.</p><p>The next week, I found myself again in the office of my Nurse Practitioner going over everything that happened and how the medication had failed.</p><p>Again.</p><p>So, I started trying other medications and went back to feeling sick. I felt like all I was good for was sleep. From the time I came home, I gave in and slept 10+ hours at night with a 2–3-hour nap in the afternoon. I had headaches almost every morning. I was having more tremor episodes and lost a lot of the fine motor skills in my hands.</p><p>Slowly but surely, I was losing interest in participating in life. I was a failure. A good for nothing. A bump on a log. My mother made it a goal to get me out of the house every day, whether that be to go antiquing or to simply get a Diet Coke. Some days, all I could stomach was sour cream with Doritos. I started gaining weight which didn&#39;t help me feel better about myself.</p><p>Springtime of 2017, I found myself sitting on the couch of yet another therapy session with my Nurse Practitioner. He looked at me thoughtfully as we had finished talking about the different lab results completed by my regular primary care doctor. Everything was checked forwards, backwards, and sideways. I passed with flying colors and was considered healthy (a term that makes me snicker a little bit because this was probably the unhealthiest part of my life- even to this day years later).</p><blockquote><p class="fw-bold">“I think you should get a sleep study.”</p></blockquote><p>I looked puzzled at my nurse practitioner, but said nothing. He continued –</p><blockquote><p class="fw-bold">“Just to see if there is anything wrong with your sleep. I&#39;m not sure if we will find anything but it would be something to cross off the list.”</p></blockquote><p>I scoffed and rolled my eyes and thought to myself – Sleep can&#39;t be the problem. I&#39;m sleeping too much as it is.</p><p>I remember being kind of nervous and a bit skeptical sitting across from the sleep doctor in that tiny consultation. It had never dawned on me that someone would specialize in sleep and dedicate their whole practice to it. Yet, here he was, sat before me. We talked about my reason for being there, and the sleep doctor explained that mental health and sleep health were closely related.</p><p>If someone was experiencing mental illness, it was a great idea to see if they had any problems with their sleep quality.</p><p>He then went on to say that for me, he was going to use the opportunity to test all angles of my sleep because he didn&#39;t know what he was looking for. He was going to look for any abnormalities. It wasn&#39;t often that he got physically healthy-looking young women in his office, so at first glance – nothing appeared wrong.</p><p>We talked about my fatigue, how I was sleeping 10+ hours a night plus a nap in the afternoon. I didn&#39;t have fainting spells, nor did I snore. I answered his questions humdrum. I didn&#39;t understand how all of this would potentially help me feel better or, better yet, help me claim my life back.</p><p>Before I knew it, I was arriving in the evening at the sleep clinic a few weeks later ready to get the sleep study over with. I was apprehensive and nervous because I had no idea what to expect. I was led to a room by a sleep technician as they asked me questions about my bedtime routines. They explained that they try to keep everything as normal as possible to help patients feel more at ease to sleep.</p><p>The morning after my sleep study, the sleep doctor knocked, announcing his presence, and asked if he could come in. He had a clipboard with some paperwork. He looked at me and said,</p><blockquote><p class="fw-bold">“You have severe sleep apnea. It&#39;s fairly uncommon in relatively healthy young women like you.”</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;ll never forget the words that changed the whole course of my life at age 23.</p><p>The rest of his words slurred in my brain as I tried to comprehend what he just told me. I had sleep apnea. Not just sleep apnea, but severe sleep apnea. I stopped breathing at least once a minute all night long. My AHI (apnea-hypopnea index) or average breathing incidents an hour was in the 60s. Immediately, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. Wasn&#39;t sleep apnea something that happened to old, overweight men? My sleep doctor said that he suspected my sleep apnea to be caused by some structural issues, such as narrow airways.</p><p>Before I knew it, I was sitting in a room lined with mannequin heads with different CPAP masks on them. Everything was a blur as another technician and the sleep doctor explained the basics of a CPAP and the different masks. I don&#39;t even remember choosing a mask, the doctor simply said he was going to start me out on one of the more popular models of nasal masks. He told me it would take a week or so to order everything for me, but that the office would call me to come pick everything up.</p><p>My mom was waiting with the car to pick me up by the time I walked out of the sleep clinic. She was shocked and surprised when I told her my diagnosis.</p><p>I cried.</p></div>',1);var d={__name:"MyStory",setup(e){return(e,t)=>((0,o.uX)(),(0,o.CE)("section",i,[(0,o.Lk)("div",s,[(0,o.Lk)("div",l,[(0,o.Lk)("div",r,[(0,o.bF)(n.A),h])])])]))}};const m=d;var p=m}}]);
