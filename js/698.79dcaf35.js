What matters is that you recognize your faults and do your best to be productive in spite of them.</p><p>2) “Think through which values, abilities, and skills you are looking for (in that order).”</p><p>Values are a person&#39;s beliefs. When properly aligned, they make teammates compatible with each other in a working environment. Abilities are qualities that are difficult to train, like being a quick learner or problem solver. Skills are learnable things, like speaking Spanish or writing code. If a person’s values don’t align with the company’s mission or culture, no amount of ability or skill will make them a good fit for your organization in the long run.</p><p>3) “Your goal is to put the right people in the right design. First understand the responsibilities of the role and the qualities needed to fulfill them, then ascertain whether an individual has them. When you’re doing this well, there should almost be an audible ‘click’ as the person you’re hiring fits into his or her role.”</p><p>You can’t hire well if you don’t understand what you are looking for. You need to focus on understanding the position you are trying to fill. Without that, you can’t know if a candidate is a good fit.</p><p>4) “If you’re less than excited to hire someone for a particular job, don’t do it. The two of you will probably make each other miserable.”</p><p>Don’t hire someone because they are the best candidate out of everyone who applied. Hire someone because they are the right person for the job. If you don’t find the right person (if you don’t hear the “click”), keep looking.</p><p>The most important lesson I’ve learned from Ray Dalio and hiring new people is this:</p><p>Be intentional and systematic in your decision making.</p><p>You have “hired” and will continue to “hire” people for all sorts of positions in your life. You will spend your evenings, weekends, holiday seasons, and years on friends, family, and various other relationships. Unlike money spent on paying employees, the time you spend with people is time that you cannot earn back.</p><p>How do you choose who you give your time to? What does your interview process look like? Do you focus on values, abilities, and skills in that order? Do you know what you are looking for? Do you spend your time on people because they are who you want to spend time with, or because they were the best people around when you were hiring?</p>",12);var g={__name:"HiringNewPeople",setup(e){return(e,t)=>((0,n.uX)(),(0,n.CE)("section",r,[(0,n.Lk)("div",h,[(0,n.Lk)("div",null,[l,p,u,(0,n.Lk)("p",null,[(0,n.eW)("Ray Dalio is the founder of "),d,(0,n.eW)(", one of the most successful investment firms on the planet.
