I had some of these symptoms and a sleep study saved my life. </p><p>Sleep health plays a HUGE role in your everyday waking life. Sleep is the designated time your body has to rest and repair. Our bodies are designed to sleep. Good sleep improves your mood and brain functions. Sleep deprivation or lack of quality sleep can put you at risk for many different serious health problems as well as lower the quality of your everyday life. </p><p>A sleep study can be conducted in the comfort of your own home or done in a clinic, whether that be at an actual sleep clinic or the hospital. Where you complete your sleep study largely depends on your insurance, but also on which medical channels you go through to get your sleep study. Generally, one should make an appointment with your primary care doctor to go over the symptoms you’ve noticed in your life, and they should be able to refer you or get you on track to schedule a sleep study. </p><p>Your mental health care professional might refer you to a sleep study as well. It was my Nurse Practitioner of Mental Health who referred me to a sleep doctor at a sleep clinic, as I was struggling with severe depression. </p><p>I’ll admit that when my Nurse Practitioner first introduced the idea of getting a sleep study, I thought it was a load of hogwash; in my mind, I was sleeping way too much for sleep to be the problem. </p><p>However, with a gentle smile, he handed me a business card to a sleep doctor. I took it with all the intention in the world to not call for a consultation because I thought that with the right mixture of medications, I would slowly start to sleep less. As it was I was sleeping 10+ hours at night with a couple hour nap in the afternoon. </p><p>After another month or so and another failed round of medications, I had hit rock bottom. I was done with the medications as all they ever did was make me feel sick, even at the lowest dosage- lower than the recommended levels to start on. I was starting to resign myself to this life of misery. I didn’t see a future for myself. I honestly don’t think I wanted a future for myself, not with how I was feeling. Nothing in therapy was working, and even my Nurse Practitioner mentioned that I wasn’t improving as he had hoped. </p><p>Sitting again in his office, he gently brought up the topic of getting a sleep study and asked if I had called the sleep clinic for an appointment. I sighed and said that I hadn’t and that I’d lost the business card. My Nurse Practitioner gave me that same gentle smile, turned to his desk, pulled open a drawer, and retrieved another business card for the sleep doctor. </p><p>Turning back to me, he offered the card and said, “It won’t hurt anything to check.” </p><p>I remember feeling deflated in that moment and thought about how I didn’t think I could feel any lower or worse than I did. I realized that I had to change to help drag me out of this pit of despair that I found myself in. I had reached rock bottom and this business card just might be my ticket out. </p><p>I took the business card from my Nurse Practitioner and thought to myself – </p><p class="fw-bold">“What do I have to lose?”</p><p>I followed through this time and called the sleep clinic for an appointment. I needed to go in for a consultation first and then an in-clinic sleep study could be conducted. </p><p>I was surprised at what greeted me when I was ushered into my room at the sleep clinic for the actual sleep study. It felt like a hotel room, and for a moment, I could almost convince myself that I was simply on a weekend getaway. The room had a queen-sized bed with a TV set up on the wall in front. There was enough space to walk around the bed and there was a decent sized bathroom attached. </p><p>The sleep technician told me to make myself comfortable and that they would be back about a half hour before bedtime to get me hooked up to the equipment. After they excused themselves, I put down my overnight bag, threw on my pjs, did my bedtime bathroom routine and got comfy in bed with remote in hand. I settled on watching Forensic Files and before I knew it, there was a knock on the door and the sleep technician wheeled in a cart with intimidating wires and monitors on it. </p><p>The sleep technician was kind enough to explain the process to me as they attached 20+ wires to my head with this sticky gum goo paste. I have long hair, so it took a minute to get every wire where it was supposed to go. It made sense now why I found shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom. The sleep technician put a strap around my chest and leg. I had a monitor clipped on my finger as well. The sleep technician mentioned they didn’t know what we were looking for, so they were going to look for any abnormalities throughout the night. </p><p>I immediately felt like there was no way that I was going to be able to sleep with all of this on my body and I expressed my concern to the sleep technician, but they assured me that they didn’t need me to sleep much to get enough data. That helped me feel better and I took them up on the offer of a sleep aid to help me fall asleep. </p><p>It took some assistance to get all situated in the bed. With the lights out, I was left in a quiet, dark room. The sleep technician told me that once I was hooked up and in bed, the cameras would be rolling, but for some reason, that didn’t bother me much. I wanted to make sure that they got all the data they needed, however it was to be collected so that I would only have to do this one time… To silence my Nurse Practitioner once and for all. </p><p>I felt strange laying there. I was exhausted, but I felt stuck and pinned to the bed by all the attachments. I closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but the small red light on my finger monitor started bugging me to death. Of all the things to bug me during this whole sleep study, it was that dumb annoying red light that seemed to shine a beacon through my eyelids. I remember trying to get comfortable in a way that it would be hidden under a blanket. </p><p>I don’t remember much after that, I would assume that the sleep aide worked because before I knew it, I was being woken up early in the morning by the sleep technician to remove all the equipment, so I had time to get ready for the day before my meeting with the sleep doctor to discuss the findings.</p><p>The whole time I was getting ready that morning, I was trying to mentally prepare for whatever the sleep doctor was going to tell me. However, I couldn’t pinpoint which I wanted more - that we found something, or that we didn’t. If we found something, which I had no idea of what that could be, what would my life look like? What changes would I have to make? Then if we didn’t find anything- what was my next plan in treating my mental illness? I was already too sick to move forward in my life and had to come home from college. I knew I wouldn’t be able to handle a regular job and could barely leave my house, let alone interact with other people. Either way, my life was going to change, and I was going to have to make some decisions after the sleep doctor told me his findings.</p><p>The sleep doctor told me that I have severe obstructive sleep apnea and before I knew it, I was being set up with my very first CPAP machine and mask. </p><p>It was using my CPAP machine that ultimately healed my mind and body. I was so used to feeling numb from my symptoms, that it was easy to be complacent. Now that I have been on a CPAP for many years. I’m functioning at physical and mental levels I didn&#39;t even know that I could, because my body and mind are able to properly repair at night.</p><p>Over the years, when I’ve had different conversations with those struggling with mental illness, the first thing I ask is: Have you gotten a sleep study? I do this because there is a close tie between your mental health and your sleep health.</p><p>Getting a sleep study might seem like an intimidating thing. I got a sleep study and it changed my life. A sleep study could change your life too. If nothing else, a sleep study can help you know if your quality of sleep is causing physical and/or mental problems. </p><p>You have nothing to lose and everything to gain from getting a sleep study.</p></div>',1);var d={__name:"SleepStudy",setup(e){return(e,t)=>((0,a.uX)(),(0,a.CE)("section",i,[(0,a.Lk)("div",s,[(0,a.Lk)("div",l,[(0,a.Lk)("div",h,[(0,a.bF)(n.A),r])])])]))}};const u=d;var p=u}}]);
