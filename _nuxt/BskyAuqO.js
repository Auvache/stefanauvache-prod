He thought people cared as much about who he was dating and how he carried himself as they did about his music, so he indulged the media with antics and controversy. His public fall came when a pair of inflammatory interviews sparked backlash from the public. He had allowed his public persona to eclipse his dedication to his craft.

Fulfillment came not from chasing attention or standing in the spotlight, but from refining his craft and sharing his music."),e("p",null,"If you want to be successful AND live a fulfilling life, save the performance for the stage. Focus on doing your work, not what other people think about you while you are doing your work.

Practice humility. Practice your craft. Don’t foster a persona that sucks the peace out of your life. Be yourself. Do your work.")])],-1)])))}};export{H as default};
