There are things we long to do. Unfortunately, those tasks are typically suffocated by other things we wish we didn&#39;t have to do, but must, to keep the ship afloat.</p><p>Here is a mantra for when you find yourself overwhelmed by the ocean of work sitting in front of you.</p><p>Eliminate, automate, delegate, do.</p><h2>Eliminate</h2><p>What would happen if you didn&#39;t do something? What if you didn&#39;t attend a meeting, manage your social media accounts, or try to wake up early every morning?</p><p>Everyone wastes time doing things that simply don&#39;t need to be done. Ask yourself if there is anything you do that simply doesn&#39;t need to be completed. Then don&#39;t do that thing.</p><h2>Automate</h2><p>If it must be done, is there a way to make the task easier in the future? Can you make a spreadsheet to automate budget calculations? Can you set up an automatic email response?</p><p>Automate processes to reduce workload.</p><h2>Delegate</h2><p>Is there something that needs to be done, but not necessarily by you? Is there something you do that others are already doing? Can someone else report back to you on a meeting? Can you give part of a project to a team member and trust them to get it done?</p><p>Do not push things unnecessarily onto other people in a bout of laziness. If you need help, ask for it. Leverage those around you to get work done.</p><h2>Do</h2><p>You should now have a shortened list of tasks that you have to accomplish. Now, do your work.</p><p>Block out a chunk of time, shut out distractions, and do your work. Do similar tasks at the same time. Answer emails in one session. Don&#39;t answer work messages while you are making a presentation, fixing a chunk of code, or designing a new company logo. For the love of all that is holy, don&#39;t watch YouTube while you are working. Focus on the task at hand.</p><br><p>This mantra applies to work, school, household chores, sports, training, building relationships, and just about any situation in which you have something to accomplish.</p><p>Eliminate, automate, delegate, do.</p>',20),p={class:"resources"},m=(0,a.Lk)("p",null,"Resources",-1),l=["href"];var u={__name:"EliminateAutomateDelegateDo",setup(t){return(t,e)=>((0,a.uX)(),(0,a.CE)("section",h,[(0,a.Lk)("div",i,[(0,a.Lk)("div",null,[r,(0,a.Lk)("div",p,[m,(0,a.Lk)("ul",null,[(0,a.Lk)("li",null,[(0,a.Lk)("a",{href:(0,n.R1)(s).books.the4HourWorkWeek,target:"_blank"},"The 4-Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferriss",8,l)])])])])])]))}};const d=u;var c=d},485:function(t){t.exports=JSON.parse('{"books":{"theAlchemist":"https://amzn.to/4deeuFz","deepWork":"https://amzn.to/4fdbN8V","mansSearchForMeaning":"https://amzn.to/3LAFvXM","theWarOfArt":"https://amzn.to/3ymtMcp","littlePrinces":"https://amzn.to/3zSEfwJ","freakonomics":"https://amzn.to/4fvlAHR","mastery":"https://amzn.to/3Sn2E3Y","the48LawsOfPower":"https://amzn.to/3XjL8QN","chronicles":"https://amzn.to/4dDJbVj","meditations":"https://amzn.to/3WAGPQP","onWriting":"https://amzn.to/3SN0JWL","howToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeople":"https://amzn.to/4fpBh32","influence":"https://amzn.to/3A5eLfE","focalPoint":"https://amzn.to/3StJ46c","theRichestManInBabylon":"https://amzn.to/3Yl6Gh5","the4HourWorkWeek":"https://amzn.to/3LIYway","toolsOfTitans":"https://amzn.to/3Abupq4","officerClemmons":"https://amzn.to/3WGNwQ4","theArtofLearning":"https://amzn.to/3ySmmhy","thinkLikeAFreak":"https://amzn.to/4fV2wCS","gordonRamsay":"https://amzn.to/4dSLtPT","taoTeChing":"https://amzn.to/3ACnOVK","philosophyOfSoftwareDesign":"https://amzn.to/4dxYa2R","leonardoDaVinci":"https://amzn.to/3ACswmu","theCodeBreaker":"https://amzn.to/477BSTs","thePhoenixProject":"https://amzn.to/3Zo9BWL","theDevOpsHandbook":"https://amzn.to/3XneA7w","theBoysInTheBoat":"https://amzn.to/4eP1Ayx","excellentAdviceForLiving":"https://amzn.to/3Nppi8M","perennialSeller":"https://amzn.to/3AA9qgW","principles":"https://amzn.to/4fWbm2Q","creativityInc":"https://amzn.to/3CPvTHC","slowProductivity":"https://amzn.to/4eT0u4B","thePowerOfHalf":"https://amzn.to/4g69cxu"}}')}}]);
