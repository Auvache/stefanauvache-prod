Anyone would be hard pressed to cut a phrase from that book without making it worse. If books were people, <em>The War of Art </em>would have 3% body fat.</p><p>But the thing that makes Steven Pressfield a great writer isn&#39;t the leanness of his writing. Every portion of <em>The War of Art</em> is meaningful. His singular focus on what he calls <em>Resistance </em>captivates and inspires the reader.</p><p>The main characteristic of great writing is something great to write about.</p><p>If I could append a sentence to Scott Adams&#39; nigh perfect blog post, it would be this:</p><p>&quot;<em>That&#39;s it.
