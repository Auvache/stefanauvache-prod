There are things we long to do. Unfortunately, those tasks are typically suffocated by other things we wish we didn&#39;t have to do, but must, to keep the ship afloat.</p><p>Here is a mantra for when you find yourself overwhelmed by the ocean of work sitting in front of you.</p><p>Eliminate, automate, delegate, do.</p><h2>Eliminate</h2><p>What would happen if you didn&#39;t do something? What if you didn&#39;t attend a meeting, manage your social media accounts, or try to wake up early every morning?</p><p>Everyone wastes time doing things that simply don&#39;t need to be done. Ask yourself if there is anything you do that simply doesn&#39;t need to be completed. Then don&#39;t do that thing.</p><h2>Automate</h2><p>If it must be done, is there a way to make the task easier in the future? Can you make a spreadsheet to automate budget calculations? Can you set up an automatic email response?</p><p>Automate processes to reduce workload.</p><h2>Delegate</h2><p>Is there something that needs to be done, but not necessarily by you? Is there something you do that others are already doing? Can someone else report back to you on a meeting? Can you give part of a project to a team member and trust them to get it done?</p><p>Do not push things unnecessarily onto other people in a bout of laziness. If you need help, ask for it. Leverage those around you to get work done.</p><h2>Do</h2><p>You should now have a shortened list of tasks that you have to accomplish. Now, do your work.</p><p>Block out a chunk of time, shut out distractions, and do your work. Do similar tasks at the same time. Answer emails in one session. Don&#39;t answer work messages while you are making a presentation, fixing a chunk of code, or designing a new company logo. For the love of all that is holy, don&#39;t watch YouTube while you are working.
