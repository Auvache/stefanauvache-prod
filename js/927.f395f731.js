Using a CPAP is a persnickety process for me. I’ve realized over the years that there were certain things that helped with my CPAP usage outside of the CPAP itself.</p><p>Looking at my bedroom, I wondered how to create the optimal place to be successful with my CPAP. How could I create an environment that promotes comfort, safety, peace, and sleep. I do use sleep as my main form of mental health management, and I feel like I’ve been successful in doing this over the years.</p><p>Now, I don’t pretend that I’m an interior decorator or a professional sleep expert, but I focus on incorporating things in my bedroom that make me feel good. It is easier for me to accept my CPAP both mentally and physically in a safe space. This thinking has helped me develop my own personal sleep environment and sleep hygiene.</p><p>Sleep hygiene as defined by the CDC is “Good Sleep Habits that can help you get a good night’s sleep.”</p><p>Think about it; chances are, you sleep better in your own space than somewhere you’ve never been before or simply don’t feel comfortable in. (Giving my college dorms and apartments the side eye.) Plus, you’ll sleep better if you develop habits for yourself that help you wind down for bed.</p><p>Therefore, two questions to ask yourself would be:</p><ul><li>What makes up my sleep scape/environment?</li><li>What are my good sleep habits that help me with my CPAP? So glad you asked.</li></ul><p>Here are my answers to these questions.</p><h2>My Sleep Scape</h2><h3>Temperature</h3><p>It’s hard to sleep when it’s too cold or too hot, and this largely depends on the season. I live in the Pacific Northwest where it&#39;s wet and mild for the most part, but it can get hot and dry for a few months in the summer and it can get cold here and there in the winter.</p><ul><li>When it’s cold – I like to wear long loose socks as my feet get cold, plus bundle up under a nice down comforter and homemade quilt. Usually, yoga pants and a soft sweatshirt/shirt goes with everything nicely.</li><li>When it’s hot- I love the “lazy one-nightshirts&quot; and I still keep my down comforter, but oftentimes I trade the quilt out for a thinner throw blanket that I can use if the down comforter is too hot.</li></ul><h3>Sound</h3><p>It’s hard for me to sleep in a completely quiet room. My CPAP is almost silent, and often all I hear is my own breathing. Which doesn’t bother me too much, but still can be distracting. Regardless of the weather or the time of year, I love to keep my fan on. It provides a comforting sound and gives my brain something to focus on as I fall asleep with my CPAP. Another thing I do is sleep with the door shut. I can’t sleep if I hear my house creaking. All it does is make me halfway believe my delusions of someone being in my house. Nope. They can just rob me with my door closed. I’ll deal with it in the morning.</p><h3>Air Circulation</h3><p>CPAPs pressurize the air from the environment in which they are placed. This is another reason why I keep the fan on all night long, all year long. Sometimes I feel a little stuffy without a fan. Then add a CPAP going with the humidifier and heated hose on to help with dry mouth and nose (since I use a full-face CPAP mask), it quickly becomes a lot. During the summer, I like to have the window open as more fresh air can fill up my room. </p><h3>Smell</h3><p>I’m not a huge scent girl. I try to keep my room neutral and smelling clean. I don’t have perfumes in my room and the wipes I use to wipe down my CPAP with are special neutral smelling CPAP wipes. I keep things picked up and washed, so it smells clean. However, a couple years ago I did sleep with lavender smells in my room to help promote sleep and I would have to say that that was very nice too. Something else to consider would be what detergent you’re washing your bedsheets in. I have sensitive skin so I make my own laundry detergent, so it doesn’t have an overpowering smell. </p><h3>Feel/Touch</h3><p>Things should feel comforting when you go to sleep. For example, do you have your preferred fabric type for your bedsheets? I tend to like my sheets a bit on the silky side using 100% cotton with a 400 thread count, those are a little cooler to the touch. Pillows are also important. What kind of pillow do you rest your head on? I like a thinner pillow because it helps my CPAP mask not leak as much. I do sleep sitting up a little bit as this helps my sleep apnea as well, so I lean the thinner pillow up on a puffier pillow. I do have a body pillow that I like to hug or have it line my back as I primarily sleep on my side. The touch of the pillow along my spine is really comforting to me. Perhaps you have your own comfort item that helps you sleep easier? Something else that I use is a weighted blanket. I struggle a lot with nighttime anxiety, and a weighted blanket helps me stay calm as I get ready to count sheep. </p><h3>Color</h3><p>This one might sound out there, but color plays a huge role in how you feel in a room. There are some colors that promote calmness. Personally, I love the red color family. Three of my walls are a light pink and the fourth wall is a red beet color. It’s what I like and makes me feel at home when I walk in there. My bedsheets are in a similar color palette to compliment the paint. Is it what is trending right now? No, I don’t think so – but it’s what I like and enjoy.</p><h3>Light</h3><p>I like darkness when I’m asleep for the most part. I have blackout curtains that I love and use often, but sometimes I like to leave my curtains open so I can wake up when the sun’s up. This is especially the case in the summer. However, when it’s not dark enough, those curtains do their job well… Also another reason to have my door shut.</p><p>I recognize this might seem like a lot to think about when it comes to your own personal sleep scape. However, I found that if I create a room that I like and feel at home in, chances are that it can make using the CPAP a little easier. And low and behold, it’s worked and now I have a whole sleep environment recipe that I know will help me with my CPAP use. </p><h2>My Sleep Hygiene</h2><h3>Shower</h3><p>I start my night routine around 7:30 pm -8:00 pm with a shower. I like to use the hot water to calm myself down and to start the relaxation process. I wash my face clean to prep for CPAP use.</p><h3>After shower</h3><p>This is where I floss, brush my teeth, and lotion up. I always take care to lotion my face because again, using a CPAP mask can dry out and irritate skin. I’ll also put on some clean pajamas.</p><h3>CPAP Mask Care</h3><p>This is when I wipe my CPAP mask down. I like to wipe it with my CPAP wipes and then give it some time to air dry before use, which quite honestly doesn’t take very long especially since I have the fan on. Usually, my mask is sitting on my bed or in my bedside table drawer all day and I want my mask at its freshest when I use it. Deeper cleans with water and mild dish soap I do earlier in the day as more time is required for it to dry. I also make sure I have enough distilled water, I have a CSpring that helps with this. It will put more water in my CPAP if it runs out in the middle of the night. </p><h3>Read/Write</h3><p>While I wait for my mask to dry, I’ll grab my kindle to read a book or my journal to write some of my feelings. I try to stay off my phone before bed so I don’t distract myself from falling asleep. It also helps to write before bed because I dump all my complicated thoughts on paper, so I don’t have to think about them while I try to fall asleep.</p><h3>Lights-out</h3><p>When I’m feeling tired enough to sleep and its lights go out, there are a few things I do. One, I put my hair up in a bun with a silk scrunchie to protect my hair from the CPAP straps. Then I put my CPAP mask on and make any needed adjustments. I usually don’t have to do anything to the top straps, but the bottom straps can get a little too tight if I’m not careful. Then, I nestle into my pillow and it’s goodnight all by 10 pm.</p><br><br><p>CPAP compliance, the number of hours needed to prove to insurance that CPAP therapy is an effective treatment, usually means achieving 4 hours of CPAP sleep each night. I’ve settled on being someone who goes to bed early and gets up early for the sake of getting more hours with my CPAP. I end up taking it off in the middle of the night a lot for who knows what reason (I’m working on figuring it out with my sleep doctor). So early bedtime it is for me. Then, I naturally wake up around 6:00-6:30. </p><p>So, there you have it. CPAP isn’t easy for me, but it’s the best solution for my sleep apnea at the moment. Sleep is crucial for me in managing depression and daytime anxiety, as well as calming my night anxiety. I want to do all in my power to ensure as much CPAP success as possible.</p><p>My life depends on it. </p><p>Yours might too. </p></div>",1);var p={__name:"SleepScape",setup(e){return(e,t)=>((0,a.uX)(),(0,a.CE)("section",i,[(0,a.Lk)("div",n,[(0,a.Lk)("div",l,[(0,a.Lk)("div",h,[(0,a.bF)(s.A),r])])])]))}};const d=p;var m=d}}]);
