He thought people cared as much about who he was dating and how he carried himself as they did about his music, so he indulged the media with antics and controversy.

Recognition can lead to distraction and perceived public expectation. Those distractions and expectations can shift your priorities away from doing meaningful, fulfilling work. It is easy to let ego-boosting success bleed into and damage other parts of our lives.

They don’t.” He thought that people would be disappointed if he didn’t live the rockstar lifestyle, and it cost him dearly."),e("p",null,"After a few years living off the Hollywood radar, John Mayer reemerged with a much different, more introspective lifestyle.

Fulfillment came not from chasing attention or standing in the spotlight, but from refining his craft and sharing his music."),e("p",null,"If you want to be successful AND live a fulfilling life, save the performance for the stage. Focus on doing your work, not what other people think about you while you are doing your work. You can’t control what other people think and you can’t eliminate the notoriety that accompanies success, but you don’t have to indulge either of them. Let your results speak for themselves. Practice humility. Practice your craft. Don’t foster a persona that sucks the peace out of your life. Be yourself. Do your work.")])],-1)])))}};export{k as default};
