I started with a nasal only mask and had used that for the first couple years. However, I struggled keeping my mouth closed as it would fall open due to me requiring a higher air pressure. That being said, I switched to a full-face CPAP mask model. </p><p>The full-face CPAP mask (or hybrid CPAP mask as some might categorize it) that I currently wear is the ResMed Airfit F30i. You can purchase the mask as a whole or you can order the different pieces as you need them or when it’s time to replace them. The suggested time frame is to replace your whole mask every 3 months.</p><p>If you need help figuring out what size you need for your mask cushion - <a href="https://document.resmed.com/documents/products/mask/airfit-f30i/cushion-fitting-guide/airfit-f30i_fitting-temp_web-inch_eng.pdf" target="_blank">here is the sizing chart from ResMed</a> that you can print out for help!</p><p>As someone who has struggled with health insurance covering the costs of my mask, I find that I like to spread out the cost by purchasing the individual pieces as I go. However, keep in mind that this is my personal experience. I’ve had multiple insurance companies and plans, and they all treat sleep apnea needs in vastly different ways. </p><p class="tagline"><i>*Understand that I’m speaking from an American point of view. I understand that not everywhere in the world has this issue when it comes to getting CPAP supplies. </i></p><p>It’s also important to note how important it is getting the correct size. I wear a small size for both the cushion and frame. It is also possible to mix and match sizes, so you can find the right fit for your face. From all the content I’ve made about this specific mask, it has been overwhelmingly positive. </p><p>Something important to know about CPAP masks in general is that some of them have a magnetic clip on the straps. Examples of this would be the ResMed Airfit F30i or the Philips Respironics Dreamwear Full Face Mask. This is because the magnets can interfere with other medical equipment you or your partner might have, such as a pacemaker. Therefore, if you have such medical equipment- <span class="fw-bold">DO NOT USE THIS MASK</span>. However, if you or your partner don’t have any other medical equipment, then you are fine using this mask.</p><p>I shop around for the different mask parts and buy them individually as I need them to try to keep costs down. I’ve found more than once that sometimes going to someplace like Amazon can be cheaper than going through my insurance. However, that being said, make sure you go the route that makes the most sense for your wallet. </p><p>I will do my best to make sure this list of mask parts is up to date as sometimes some pieces aren’t available. Something else to note is that you can mix and match sizes if needed. Perhaps you need a small cushion but a standard frame.</p><p>The size that I use is a small cushion with a small frame.</p><h2>RESMED AIRFIT F30i Mask Parts: </h2><ul class="list-unstyled"><li><a href="https://amzn.to/42maGxB" target="_blank">Small Cushion</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3vO0CBl" target="_blank">CPAP Mask Liners (S)</a></li><br><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47QEmEk" target="_blank">Small Wide</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/49fhE9X" target="_blank">CPAP Mask Liners (SW)</a></li><br><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47ZgyhD" target="_blank">Medium Cushion</a></li><li>CPAP Mask Liners (M) - currently unavailable</li><br><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4b9OXwW" target="_blank">Wide Cushion</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3UksgjO" target="_blank">CPAP Mask Liners (W)</a></li><br><li>Small Frame- Not available at the moment</li><li>Standard Frame -Not available at the moment</li><li>Large Frame- Not available at the moment</li><br><li>*Can be found on CPAP Product Websites. </li><br><li><a href="https://amzn.to/47Y9bXR" target="_blank">Elbow Connector</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3vOmfl1" target="_blank">Headgear (One Size Fits ALL)</a></li></ul><h2>MASK ADJUSTMENT TIPS</h2><p>A common complaint with new users of this mask is getting leaks by the nose that blows into their eyes. Here are some tips that help me use this mask while rarely getting a leak. </p><ol><li>Adjust the CPAP mask laying down. You should be doing this with any CPAP mask you are using. </li><li>Relax your jaw and chin while adjusting the straps of the headgear, you don’t want to adjust the headgear to a jaw/chin position where you aren’t relaxed, because once asleep, it will relax anyway and you’ll get leaks.</li><li>When putting the cushion on your face, don’t put it straight on your face. Angle it up your nose a little. Your nose probably isn’t a straight line as a perfect triangle on your face. Your nose sits on your face at an angle so, put the mask under your nose accordingly.</li><li>Adjust the top straps first as those pull the mask <span class="fw-bold"><i>up</i></span> your face. This will help you find the right fit and snugness around your nose.</li><li>Adjust the bottom straps last as those pull the mask <span class="fw-bold"><i>into</i></span> your face. These are probably the straps you’ll adjust the most often, however, don’t forget to keep your jaw and chin relaxed as this is where you are sealing the bottom of the mask.</li></ol><p>I will also say that I’ve found this mask model to work best for my side sleeping self. I haven’t run into problems of disrupting the airflow on the side I’m sleeping on and with how this mask fits snugly around my nose without being tight, I’m able to move around no problem without many leaks. </p><p>I’ve found in general that it can be hard to get the tightness right with CPAP masks. Something that I had to learn was to trust my CPAP mask to stay on my face. That trust applies to all the different masks that I’ve used over the years. You don’t need it as tight as you probably think. If you are finding it hard to loosen it and it leaks too much, you might not have the right fit of mask for your face structure.</p><p>If you find yourself struggling because of how you need to wear your CPAP mask, <a href="https://amzn.to/3SncrYg" target="_blank">these CPAP mask liners</a> can help a lot.</p><p>I hope this information helps you figure out how to better use your CPAP mask so that you can get that glorious healthy sleep! </p></div>',1);var u={__name:"ResMed",setup(e){return(e,t)=>((0,s.uX)(),(0,s.CE)("section",o,[(0,s.Lk)("div",n,[(0,s.Lk)("div",r,[(0,s.Lk)("div",l,[(0,s.bF)(i.A),h])])])]))}};const m=u;var d=m}}]);
