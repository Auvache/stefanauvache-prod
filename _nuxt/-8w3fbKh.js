You just learned 80% of the rules of good writing.

Every portion of The War of Art is meaningful. His singular focus on what he calls Resistance captivates and inspires the reader.</p><p>The main characteristic of great writing isn’t style—it’s substance. The best writers write about things worth writing about.</p><h2>Do Meaningful Things</h2><p>The same is true in life.</p><p>There are strategies for skill acquisition, personal growth, financial freedom, and career success. You can use as many productivity tools as you want. All of the tools in the world won’t help you feel fulfilled if they don’t help you do worthwhile things.</p><p>When setting goals or making life plans, follow a simple rule: focus first on meaning. Choose projects, habits, and pursuits that matter to you and make a positive impact on the people around you. Intentionally creating meaningful goals will make your days feel more purposeful and help you feel more fulfilled in life.</p><p>If I could append a sentence to Scott Adams&#39; near-perfect blog post, it would be this:<br> &quot;That&#39;s it.
