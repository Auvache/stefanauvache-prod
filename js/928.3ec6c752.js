It is the firefighting and damage control and unforeseen consequences that prevent planned work from getting done. Luckily for us (and Bill), there are ways to prevent and minimize the damage caused by unplanned work.</p><h2>Visibility</h2><p>First, visibility. If you don’t know everything that has to happen to complete a project, you cannot accurately plan a timeline for the completion of said project. If you don’t know how many projects and responsibilities you have, you can’t coordinate resources to work on your projects, and nothing gets done.</p><p>This is as true in IT, business, and manufacturing as it is in raising kids, getting a degree, and personal hygiene. It would be great to have a fulfilling career, a business on the side, a rock band to play in, a published novel, a thriving social life, and still have time to take your kids to the park and take the dog on a walk. But you can’t, and you won’t. If you can’t gauge how full the proverbial plate is, you can’t accurately manage your work.</p><p>In Bill’s case, he set up a notecard system to track all work that needed to be completed in the IT department. At first, it seemed to create more work for everyone. Who wants to organize hundreds of notecards? The team quickly realized that it didn’t create more work; it shined a light on how much work there was to actually accomplish.</p><p>You can do something similar in your personal workload, whether it be school work, career oriented, or general time management.</p><p>Write down a list of every piece of work you need to do. It can be as granular as you need it to be. Set meetings (work meetings, classes, dropping your kid off at soccer practice) count as work to be done.</p><p>The list might overwhelm you, and you probably forgot something. But that’s ok. The point is to get a view of how much work you have on your plate.</p><h2>Prioritize, organize, and do work</h2><p>Once Bill (our fated hero) knows how much work there is to do, he prioritizes the work based on what is most important.
