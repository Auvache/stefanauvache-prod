If you are surrounded by distraction and interruption, you will have a great deal of difficulty working deeply on anything. Find a place where it is quiet—both physically and digitally—to do your work. Choose a place where you are essentially alone, if not totally alone.</p><p>Once you have a place to do work, set aside a chunk of time and protect it. It can be 45 minutes or three hours, but it needs to be long enough for you to get some work done without anyone coming to interrupt you.</p>',11)),t("p",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("At the extreme, people like Bill Gates, Carl Jung, and Haruki Murakami ")),a(s,{to:"/articles/monk-week-solitude-intentional-living"},{default:r(()=>e[0]||(e[0]=[o("spend weeks or months at a time in isolation")])),_:1}),e[2]||(e[2]=o(" to better focus on their work."))]),e[15]||(e[15]=t("h3",null,"Avoid Context Switching and Attention Residue",-1)),e[16]||(e[16]=t("p",null,"Focusing on a single task puts your brain in a specific context.
