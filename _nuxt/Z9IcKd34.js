The more stories I hear from someone, the better I know them, and the better the conversation tends to be.</p><p>I call this the Biography Method.</p><p>The Biography Method is a way of interacting with others by imagining that you are getting ready to write their biography. When you approach conversations from this angle, you become more curious in stories, empathetic about opinions and decisions, and focused on understanding the other person. This shift in perspective encourages active listening, thoughtful questions, and appreciation for the life experiences of the person you&#39;re talking to.</p><h2 class="mb-3">Key concepts for application</h2><ul><li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Instead of sticking to small talk, push yourself to dig deeper. Be genuinely curious about someone’s background, experiences, and values.</li><li><strong>Active listening and questions:</strong> Listening is more than just hearing words—it&#39;s about understanding the feelings and thoughts behind them. Active listening is incomplete without relevant questions. You can stop someone mid-story to ask clarifying questions.</li><li><strong>Sharing your own stories:</strong> Connection is a two-way street. Don’t overshadow others with your own stories, but respond genuinely to others as if they were trying to learn about your life as well.</li><li><strong>Building understanding:</strong> Misunderstandings often happen when people come from different backgrounds or have different views. Be curious, not opinionated. Connection comes through learning, not through judging.</li></ul><p>The Biography Method can be used in professional settings, personal relationships, and in casual encounters with new people. It can create trust in business settings, deepen romantic attachment, and make conversation easier and more meaningful.</p><p>So, next time you find yourself at a ball game with a friend, on a first date, at family dinner, or on a park bench with a stranger, be a little more like Mr. Rogers and try to connect with people. Ask them where they are from. Ask how they ended up here, of all places, and where they want to go next.</p><p>Give the Biography Method a try.</p><p>Everyone has a story to tell.
