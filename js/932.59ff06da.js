Scott Adams changed mine.</p><p>Adams is the mastermind behind <a target="_blank" href="https://dilbert.com/"> the Dilbert comic strip </a>. He also has a blog. <a target="_blank" href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html"> One of the articles on that blog </a> is about becoming a better writer.</p><p>Adam&#39;s says, in a nutshell:</p><ul><li>Keep it simple</li><li>Get rid of extra words</li><li>The first sentence should grab the reader</li><li>Avoid multiple thoughts in a single sentence</li></ul><p>Basically, writing should be as easy to understand as possible. Make your work entertaining, but not at the expense of simplicity. Scott Adams&#39; 263-word post gave me the confidence to start writing daily (you&#39;re the man Scott).</p><p>The last line of the article says:</p><p><em>“That&#39;s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good writing. You&#39;re welcome.</em>”</p><p>I first assumed that the remaining 20% would include granular, complex stuff like, “know your target audience” or “have an editor run through your work.”</p>',10),h=["href"],p=(0,n.Lk)("em",null,"The War of Art",-1),m=[p],c=(0,n.Fv)("<p>Pressfield&#39;s writing embodies many of the principles from Adams&#39; post. His sentences are concise. His “chapters” are often a single paragraph. <em>The War of Art</em> itself barely breaks 150 pages. Anyone would be hard pressed to cut a phrase from that book without making it worse. If books were people, <em>The War of Art </em>would have 3% body fat.</p><p>But the thing that makes Steven Pressfield a great writer isn&#39;t the leanness of his writing. Every portion of <em>The War of Art</em> is meaningful. His singular focus on what he calls <em>Resistance </em>captivates and inspires the reader.</p><p>The main characteristic of great writing is something great to write about.</p><p>If I could append a sentence to Scott Adams&#39; nigh perfect blog post, it would be this:</p><p>“<em>That&#39;s it. You just learned 80% or the rules of good writing. Now find something worth writing about.”</em></p><p>Write simply. Keep it lean. Convey ideas to your audience as clearly as possible. And, for the love of Scott and Steven, write about something meaningful.</p>",6),u={class:"sources"},d=(0,n.Lk)("p",null,"Sources",-1),f=(0,n.Lk)("li",null,[(0,n.Lk)("a",{target:"_blank",href:"https://dilbert.com/"}," https://dilbert.com ")],-1),b=(0,n.Lk)("li",null,[(0,n.Lk)("a",{target:"_blank",href:"https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html"}," https://dilbertblog.typepad.com ")],-1),g=["href"],k=(0,n.Lk)("em",null,"The war of art: Break through the blocks and win your inner creative battles",-1);var w={__name:"BetterBusinessWriting",setup(e){return(e,t)=>((0,n.uX)(),(0,n.CE)("section",r,[(0,n.Lk)("div",i,[(0,n.Lk)("div",null,[l,(0,n.Lk)("p",null,[(0,n.eW)("Then I read "),(0,n.Lk)("a",{target:"_blank",href:(0,s.R1)(o).books.theWarOfArt},m,8,h),(0,n.eW)(" by Steven Pressfield.")]),c,(0,n.Lk)("div",u,[d,(0,n.Lk)("ol",null,[f,b,(0,n.Lk)("li",null,[(0,n.Lk)("a",{href:(0,s.R1)(o).books.theWarOfArt,target:"_blank"},"The War of Art by Steven Pressfield",8,g),(0,n.eW)(": Pressfield, S.
