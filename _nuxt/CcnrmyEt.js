Make your work entertaining, but not at the expense of simplicity. Scott Adams&#39; 263-word post gave me the confidence to start writing daily (you&#39;re the man Scott).</p><p>The last line of the article says:</p><p><em>&quot;That&#39;s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good writing. You&#39;re welcome.</em>&quot;</p><p>I first assumed that the remaining 20% would include granular, complex stuff like, &quot;know your target audience&quot; or &quot;have an editor run through your work.&quot;</p>',10)),t("p",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=l("Then I read ")),t("a",{target:"_blank",href:u(r).books.theWarOfArt},e[0]||(e[0]=[t("em",null,"The War of Art",-1)]),8,A),e[2]||(e[2]=l(" by Steven Pressfield."))]),e[7]||(e[7]=n("<p>Pressfield&#39;s writing embodies many of the principles from Adams&#39; post.

Anyone would be hard pressed to cut a phrase from that book without making it worse. If books were people, <em>The War of Art </em>would have 3% body fat.</p><p>But the thing that makes Steven Pressfield a great writer isn&#39;t the leanness of his writing. Every portion of <em>The War of Art</em> is meaningful. His singular focus on what he calls <em>Resistance </em>captivates and inspires the reader.</p><p>The main characteristic of great writing is something great to write about.</p><p>If I could append a sentence to Scott Adams&#39; nigh perfect blog post, it would be this:</p><p>&quot;<em>That&#39;s it. You just learned 80% or the rules of good writing. Now find something worth writing about.&quot;</em></p><p>Write simply. Keep it lean. Convey ideas to your audience as clearly as possible.
