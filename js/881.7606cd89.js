I am someone who has a lot of experience living with sleep apnea, talking with medical professionals about sleep apnea and treatments, and using a CPAP as treatment. </i></p><p>I wish that people understood this: not all sleep apnea cases are the same. It should be common knowledge that sleep apnea can occur at any age and with any body type. At this point, thanks to the size of my platform, I’ve had the opportunity to speak with many people about their own sleep apnea diagnosis. It has been interesting to hear their experiences and how sleep apnea looks in their lives. </p><p>Sleep apnea is not a simple diagnosis of one who simply stops breathing while asleep. First thing to understand about a sleep apnea diagnosis is that there are three different types of sleep apnea:</p><h2 class="t3">Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)</h2><p>This one is by far the most common and often what people are referring to when they say they have sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is when throat muscles/soft tissues located around the mouth/jaw/tongue relax and block the flow of air in the upper airway from reaching the lungs. </p><h2 class="t3">Central Sleep Apnea (CSA)</h2><p>This type of sleep apnea occurs when the brain misfires and doesn’t send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing while asleep. </p><h2 class="t3">Complex Sleep Apnea (CompSAS)</h2><p>This is when obstructive sleep apnea develops into central sleep apnea. Therefore, it is a combo between obstructive and central sleep apnea.</p><p>Sleep apnea lies on a spectrum depending on your severity. The severity of your sleep apnea is determined by the combined average number of times you stop breathing (apneas<sup>1</sup> and hypopneas<sup>2</sup>) per hour you’re asleep. The number of breathing events is referred to as AHI, which stands for apnea-hypopnea index. </p><ol><li><i>Apnea: Temporary cessation of breathing, especially during sleep.</i></li><li><i>Hypopnea: Abnormally slow or shallow breathing.</i></li></ol><p>Based on your AHI, you’re sleep apnea can then be categorized as: </p><ol><li>Mild: 5-15 Events per Hour</li><li>Moderate: 15-30 Events per Hour</li><li>Severe: More than 30 Events per Hour</li></ol><p>Depending on which category your sleep apnea falls under, as well as the type of sleep apnea you have; will help determine what type of treatments will be effective in treating your sleep apnea. I’m most well versed in treatments for obstructive sleep apnea.</p><p>If you are diagnosed with sleep apnea- it’s important to understand what options are available to you to treat your sleep apnea effectively depending on your severity and type of sleep apnea. Below are some options that I know of. <span class="fw-bold">I would advise you to ask a medical professional about what works best for you.</span> Gather as much information as you can so you can make the best health decisions for you. I will also note that there are new treatments being developed all the time. Stay informed as something better might come to help you with your sleep apnea. </p><h2>Treatments to Consider, Research and Ask your Medical Professional About:</h2><h3>Lifestyle Changes</h3><p>Modifying lifestyle in combination with other sleep apnea treatments can help you manage your sleep apnea. It’s not often that lifestyle changes alone are enough, as it largely depends on the reason for your sleep apnea. </p><p>(For example: If you have sleep apnea due to jaw structure or narrow airways – losing weight will not cure your sleep apnea. But it can improve other sleep apnea treatments)</p><p>Being aware of certain behaviors can help make improvements in managing your sleep apnea and overall health. </p><ul><li><span class="fw-bold">Reduce Weight</span> - This seems to be the go-to thing people say when they hear someone has sleep apnea. Reducing weight around the neck can help with OSA but often it is not the cure all. However, struggling with untreated sleep apnea can cause weight gain. Personally, I have lost anywhere from 30-40 lbs. and have not seen any improvement in my sleep apnea. However, my CPAP tolerance has improved.</li><li><span class="fw-bold">Avoid Alcohol</span> - Alcohol can worsen breathing events by making them last longer and happen more often. It is recommended for people with OSA to either stop drinking or to limit drinking to earlier hours in the day.</li><li><span class="fw-bold">Avoid Sedatives</span> - These can worsen breathing events that are already occurring due to OSA as it can relax muscles further, much like with drinking alcohol. Work with your doctor if you do need medications. From my experience, I’ve needed a higher pressure on CPAP while on different medications for depression and anxiety as medications relax the throats muscles further.</li><li><span class="fw-bold">Avoid Sleeping On Your Back</span> - Gravity pulls everything back easier on your back than on your side or stomach.</li><li><span class="fw-bold">Exercise </span> - Exercise improves your whole body, including the muscles in your throat. I’ve felt a huge improvement in the quality of my breathing thanks to exercise.</li></ul><h3>PAP Therapies – Positive Airway Pressure Devices</h3><ul><li><span class="fw-bold">CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure)</span> - The most common/basic form of treatment for sleep apnea. A CPAP provides a constant air pressure to keep your airways open, so you keep breathing while asleep. What level your air pressure is at is what is prescribed depending on your AHI.</li><li><span class="fw-bold">APAP (Auto- adjusting positive airway pressure)</span> - These machines automatically adjust the air pressure based on the patient’s needs.</li><li><span class="fw-bold">BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure)</span> - BiPAP has a higher pressure when you breathe in and a lower pressure when you breathe out. Pressures prescribed according to your AHI. Most likely prescribed if one responds poorly to CPAP therapy.</li><li><span class="fw-bold">ASV (Adaptive servo-ventilation)</span> - A type of BiPAP machine that automatically adjusts to the inhalation pressure of the patient. These devices are often used for those who have both OSA and CSA.</li></ul><h3>Oral Appliances</h3><ul><li><span class="fw-bold">Mandibular Advancement Device (Mouth Guard)</span> - It pushes your jaw forward to keep your airway open. It’s most effective for treating those with mild to moderate sleep apnea.</li><li><span class="fw-bold">Tongue Retaining Devices</span> - Holds your tongue in place so it doesn’t block airways when sleeping on your back. It’s most effective for treating those with mild to moderate sleep apnea.</li></ul><h3>Nasal Devices</h3><ul><li><span class="fw-bold">Nasal Dilator</span> - Great for those with a deviated septum or need congestion relief. It goes inside your nose and gently pushes on the nasal airways to open them up. It’s most effective for treating those with mild to moderate sleep apnea.</li></ul><h3>Pillows</h3><ul><li><span class="fw-bold">Adjustable Position Pillow</span> - This allows you to adjust the height and angle of your neck and head. This way you can use gravity and position to keep your airways open. Can help reduce sleep apnea symptoms but other treatments might be necessary (from what I understand). </li><li><span class="fw-bold">Smart Pillows</span> - They can sense when you are snoring or struggling with breath and gently inflate a bag of air under your head accordingly to stop obstruction. Can help reduce sleep apnea symptoms but other treatments might be necessary (from what I understand).</li></ul><h3>Surgery- Often looked at to support PAP therapy</h3><ul><li><span class="fw-bold">Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)</span> - Removal or reduction of uvula to reshape the soft palate in order to open up the airway. </li><li><span class="fw-bold">Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy</span> - Tonsil and adenoid removal to improve airflow. (I had this surgery as I have narrow airways. Even though my tonsils and adenoids were of average size, they were too big for me. It helped drop my AHI from 60 to 40 without a CPAP machine. It also improved my overall breathing and I hardly suffer from seasonal allergies anymore.)</li><li><span class="fw-bold">Throat Surgeries</span> - This could look at removing extra tissue in the throat or tongue reduction surgeries. (I had extra tissue removed from my throat with the removal of my tonsils and adenoids.)</li><li><span class="fw-bold">Jaw Surgeries</span> - Reconstruction or reposition of upper and lower jaw. </li><li><span class="fw-bold">Nasal surgeries</span> - Making changes to nasal airway or nasal cavity to help other treatments work better. (I had extra tissue removed from my nose with the removal of my tonsils and adenoids.)</li></ul><h3>Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation</h3><ul><li> The only FDA approved device on the market is Inspire. This is an implant on the right side of your chest that sends electrical currents to stimulate nerves in throat muscles and push tongue forward to keep them out from blocking your airway. This is often not presented as a first method as treatment for sleep apnea as it is for if other methods of therapies (such as CPAP) have failed.</li></ul><p>If you have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, regardless of severity and cause, I hope that you investigate your options and determine what is the best for you. For me, I have severe obstructive sleep apnea due to narrow airways. My sleep apnea treatment is a combination of lifestyle changes focusing on exercise and healthy living in combination with CPAP therapy. I’ve also had surgery, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, with additional tissue from my throat and nose removed. This has been the best course of action for me, but I’m always trying to make improvements to my treatments and keep an eye out for more effective forms of treatments. </p><p>As one sleep apnea patient to another, I wish you good luck in finding what works for you and the best sleep!</p><h2>Further Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631" target="_blank">mayoclinic.org</a></li><li><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/beyond-cpap-other-options-for-sleep-apnea" target="_blank">health.harvard.edu</a></li><li><a href="https://sleepingbetter.co/sleep-apnea/cpap-alternatives/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_id=20441856473&amp;utm_content=150914619503&amp;utm_term=sleep%20apnea%20solutions&amp;creativeId=669187744740&amp;adgroupid=150914619503&amp;targetid=kwd-573607165&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqNSsBhAvEiwAn_tmxU0uMn6VT68W7e0F9yGImpTnUeBFG56tJVBvL3R_cC-oNQd_Uo9JPRoCh0cQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">sleepingbetter.co</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sleepapnea.org/treatment/" target="_blank">sleepapnea.org</a></li></ul></div>',1);var h={__name:"UnderstandingSleepApnea",setup(e){return(e,a)=>((0,s.uX)(),(0,s.CE)("section",n,[(0,s.Lk)("div",i,[(0,s.Lk)("div",r,[(0,s.Lk)("div",l,[(0,s.bF)(o.A),p])])])]))}};const d=h;var u=d}}]);
