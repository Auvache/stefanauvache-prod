Make your work entertaining, but not at the expense of simplicity. Scott Adams’ 263-word post gave me the confidence to start writing daily (you’re the man Scott).</p><p>The last line of the article says:</p><p><em>“That’s it. You just learned 80% of the rules of good writing. You’re welcome.</em>”</p><p>I first assumed that the remaining 20% would include granular, complex stuff like, “know your target audience” or “have an editor run through your work.”</p>',8),p=["href"],g=(0,n.Lk)("em",null,"The War of Art",-1),f=[g],b=(0,n.Fv)("<p>Pressfield’s writing embodies many of the principles from Adams’ post. His sentences are concise. His “chapters” are often a single paragraph. <em>The War of Art</em> itself barely breaks 150 pages. Anyone would be hard pressed to cut a phrase from that book without making it worse. If books were people, <em>The War of Art </em>would have 3% body fat.</p><p>But the thing that makes Steven Pressfield a great writer isn’t the leanness of his writing. Every portion of <em>The War of Art</em> is meaningful. His singular focus on what he calls <em>Resistance </em>captivates and inspires the reader.</p><p>The main characteristic of great writing is something great to write about.</p><p>If I could append a sentence to Scott Adams’ nigh perfect blog post, it would be this:</p><p>“<em>That’s it. You just learned 80% or the rules of good writing. Now find something worth writing about.”</em></p><p>Write simply. Keep it lean. Convey ideas to your audience as clearly as possible.
